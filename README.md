# Mini Amazon Sales Project using Snowflake SQL

This project demonstrates my skills in **Snowflake SQL** by creating a database, uploading sales data, and performing various analyses on Amazon-like sales data.

---

## What I Did

- Created Snowflake **Warehouse**, **Database**, **Schema**, **Table**, and **Stage** for CSV upload.
- Uploaded Amazon sales CSV via Snowflake UI (screenshots included).
- Ran SQL queries covering:
  - Sample data view
  - Sales by category and product
  - Total revenue and quantity sold
  - Monthly sales trends
  - Payment methods and customer locations
  - Advanced queries using CASE, Window Functions, CTEs, and Subqueries

---

## Next Steps

- Power BI dashboard to visualize the data

---

## How to Use

- Use `AMAZON_PROJECT` database and `SALES_DATA` schema.
- Check `snowflake_queries.sql` for all SQL scripts.
- See `/SQL Query` folder for Snowflake UI and query.
